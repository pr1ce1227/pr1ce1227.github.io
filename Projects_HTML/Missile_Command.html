                        This was my first exposure to embedded systems and advanced state machines. This was a bare metal C project in which we had to control the hardware through
                        low level register read and writes. The Missiel command game was a class project where we followed the class design. We were later invited to do a freestyle
                        project. (See flappy bird project) This game required several state machines to control gameflow and graphics. One for the missles being fired, one for the chain 
                        reaction explosions and one for the plane that flys over the top of the screen. I then had to created object according to the game difficulty mainly missiles and 
                        launch them across the screen. Overall this was a really fun project that showed the power of having well built state machines.

                        The video being demonstrated is the 
                        game running in an emulator. We later at the functionality need to run the game on the actual board mainly including the ability to recognize touch on the screen.
