                        This class was very cool and VERY difficult. As you can tell from the conecpts list we covered a lot in one semester. It was my first time using ROS but I 
                        was pretty comfortable with docker and linux by this point. Everything was written in python that we touched. We were only allowed to used the camera as our 
                        sensor as such it invovled a lot of image processing. Hense the Jetson nano. I know he may seem a little drunk in the video but trust me it was a huge success. 
                        It was one of the best driving cars in the classs which gave me a new found respect for the everyone working on self-driving cars. It would have been helpful to 
                        have a lidar or any other sensor for a little bit of replication but it ended up working alright in the end. It was cool to learn how image processing works and it's 
                        much more complicated then people think.

                        At the end of the day the computer just see's a bunch of 1's and 0's and so trying to get it to recognize objects that you and 
                        I can see is no small task. Overall I really enjoyed this project and it was very satisfying to just turn the robot on and let it roam around the city. This was the 
                        first time this class was taught at BYU and so a lot of the learning was left up to the students. The passing on the left functionality was our freestyel project we 
                        did at the very end of the semseter.
