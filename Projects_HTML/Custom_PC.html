                        It's hard to go through computer engineering and not want to build your own PC when your done. I'm actually not a huge PC gamer so although I have 
                        the cool RGB everywhere this is mainly for engineering. It was an interesting project because I could tell you all about how CPU's and GPU's work but 
                        I didn't know a thing about which one to buy. This lead me down into a deep rabbit whole of understanding all the different specs of each peice of hardware
                        and then trying to make sure every piece will fit together. I spent 200+ hours doing research when I finally decided on this build. It was fun though a little nerve racking
                        putting the whole thing together. It was my first time starting with only a BIOS and having to load an operating sytem on manually. When it was all said and done I was 
                        really happy with the end result and it was quite an upgrade from my dual core i7 macbook air!
