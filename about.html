            <h2 class="header">My Story</h2>

            <p class="gen_text"> Hello everyone! My name is Caleb Price. I'm currently a graduate student at Brigham Young University 
                studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I received my undergraduate from BYU in computer engineering. I did not always
                want to be a computer engineer or in fact any engineer at all. I was born on a family farm in eastern washington, where I 
                spent thousands of hours laboring in the fields and driving heavy machinery. I grew up playing football and running track and
                learned to play the trumpet and piano. After graduating high school I decided to serve a christian mission in Cape Verde. 
                This is a group of 10 islands off the west coast of Africa. I spent 2 years here, learning portuguese and 2 other african dialects,
                while teaching the people about my faith and helping them with their daily lives. <br>
                
                <br>After my service I returned to Brigham Young University
                intent on studying business marketing. I quickly became bored and decided to return to the world of numbers. I had little experience with
                engineering outside of working on farm equipment so I decided to enter mechanical engineering. Along this journey I met my beautiful wife Bronte and 
                have now been married for 4 years. After 2 years of mechanical engineering I finally took my first electrical class including circuits and coding.
                I quickly fell in love and promptly changed my major to computer engineering. I have never regretted this decision and am happy that my long journey 
                eventually lead me to this field. I am now pursuing my masters degree where my research is focused on the effects of radiation on Systems on Chips in 
                harsh environments. Whether that be in space or military applications. I love tinkering with personal projects as you will find throughout this website. If 
                you are my beautiful wife and actually made it through this long message know that I love you so very much and miss you dearly. This house is just too quiet when you 
                are not around. Love you honey.
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh and I forgot to mention a married a total BABE!
