                        This has to be my favorite project that I have accomplished. I have always been fascinated by computer architecture, and being able to build a processor
                        from the ground up, then runing a game on it that I built was very exciting. We spent the class learning all about computer architecture then reflected what
                        we had learned into our project of building a 32 bit RisV processor. The processor design included building data memory and program memory in bram, followed by
                        building a full pipeline including fetch, decode, branch, alu, memory, and store unit. In the class we went a little bit further and cover ECC protection, Virtual 
                        memory, Paging, advanced pipelining, paralellism / multi core and modern design. These were obviously too complicated for a 1 semester class but layed a great foundation
                        for computer architecture.

                        In the video you can see the Air-Hockey game that I built. In the game the left player is a human playing agains the AI on the right side. You can change the difficulty through the switches, which
                        is demonstrated in the video. After each point the difficulty is increased. The processor design was structured by the class however the game was left completly up to us to decide. I picked
                        a more challenging project to be sure as everything had to be written in assembly and then run on the processor that I built. However the challenge was very fun and I was happy 
                        with the result. I ended up winning first place for the best game and winning the $200 cash prize!
