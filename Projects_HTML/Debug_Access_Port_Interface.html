                        This was a very challenging low-level software project that utilized the firmware of the JCM (JTAG interface). The project was tough due to poor
                         documentation, either there was too little information, or it was so extensive that finding anything useful was nearly impossible. Additionally, 
                         it was difficult to track signals once they left the JCM over the JTAG cable, especially in the early stages.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite these challenges, I eventually got it to work, and it has proven to be very useful. Essentially, this project provides very low-level access to the board at runtime,
                        including access to the CoreSight registers and global address space. With this access, I can query processor registers at runtime to check if the program counter 
                        (PC) has deviated from its expected path. I can also set up "virtual" UARTs for each processor to pull logs at runtime during a test. Moreover, with access to the 
                        global address space and the Network on Chip (NoC), I virtually have access to every part of the board.
                        <br><br>
                        I learned a lot while working on this project, including the importance of taking a slower, more methodical approach at times. Working with the bits and 
                        various controllers (TAP and DAP) was tedious and required exact precision. I also gained experience in building custom libraries in C++ and was able to 
                        abstract all the heavy lifting from the user. It's as simple as writing a JSON file with the registers you want to read or write at runtime, and with a 
                        click of a button, you have access to nearly the entire board. My work with this new feature has mainly involved the Xilinx Versal ACAP chip.
