                Welcome to my website! I've always been curious about web development as it wasn't covered in my computer engineering program at BYU. 
                So, I decided to take on the challenge and learn it on my own. I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a lot of YouTube tutorials. 
                I wish I had thought of this idea sooner, as not all my projects are represented here. I could only showcase the projects for which I had pictures or 
                still had access to the supplies to recreate them. I apologize for some of the poor-quality videosâ€”many of them are just clips I happened to send to 
                my wife while working in the lab. Despite that, I'm happy with the result! Enjoy the projects, and feel free to contact me with the information below!
