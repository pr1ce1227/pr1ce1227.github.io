                        This was my first exposure to embedded systems and advanced state machines. It was a bare-metal C project where we had to control the hardware
                        through low-level register reads and writes. The Missiel Command game was a class project where we followed the class design, and later
                        we were invited to do a freestyle project (see the Flappy Bird project).
                        <br><br>
                        This game required several state machines to manage game flow and graphics, including one for the missiles being fired, one for the chain reaction explosions, 
                        and one for the plane flying across the top of the screen. I also had to create objects based on game difficulty, primarily missiles, and launch 
                        them across the screen. Overall, it was a really fun project that demonstrated the power of well-designed state machines.
                        <br><br>
                        The video being demonstrated shows the game running in an emulator. We later needed to adapt the functionality to run the game on the actual board, 
                        including the ability to recognize touch input on the screen.
