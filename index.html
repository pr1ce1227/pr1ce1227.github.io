            <p class="large_text"> Welcome to my website! I've always wondered how web development worked as it isn't covered in computer engineering at BYU. So I decided
                to take on the challenge and learn on my own. I built this website from scratch using html, css and a lot of youtube. I wish I would of had this idea sooner
                as not all my projects are represented here. I could only show the projects of pictures I had taken or still had access to the supplies to recreate them. As such I apologize for 
                some of the poor quality videos. Many of them are just what I happend to send to my wife while working in a lab but all in all I'm happy with the result. Enjoy the projects
                and feel free to contact me with the information below!
