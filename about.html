            <p class="gen_text"> Hello everyone! My name is Caleb Price. I'm currently a graduate student at Brigham Young University, studying Electrical and Computer
                 Engineering. I received my undergraduate degree from BYU in Computer Engineering. I didn’t always want to be a computer engineer or any kind of
                  engineer, for that matter.
                I was born on a family farm in eastern Washington, where I spent
                 thousands of hours laboring in the fields and driving heavy machinery. I grew up playing football,
                  running track, and learning to play the trumpet and piano. After graduating from high school, I decided to serve a Christian 
                  mission in Cape Verde, a group of 10 islands off the west coast of Africa. I spent 2 years there, learning Portuguese and two other 
                  African dialects, while teaching the people about my faith and helping them with their daily lives.
                <br><br>
                After my service, I returned to Brigham Young University with the intent of studying business marketing. I quickly became bored and 
                decided to return to the world of numbers. With little experience in engineering outside of working on farm equipment, I decided to 
                enter the field of mechanical engineering. Along this journey, I met my beautiful wife, Bronte, and we have now been married for 4 years. 
                After 2 years in mechanical engineering, I took my first electrical class, which included circuits and coding. I quickly fell in love with 
                the subject and promptly changed my major to Computer Engineering. I have never regretted this decision and am happy that my long journey 
                eventually led me to this field of study.
                <br><br>
                I am now pursuing my master’s degree, focusing my research on the effects of radiation on Systems on Chips in harsh environments, whether in 
                space or military applications. I love tinkering with personal projects, as you will see throughout this website, and I am excited to use 
                my knowledge to make this world a better place. Enjoy the projects!
