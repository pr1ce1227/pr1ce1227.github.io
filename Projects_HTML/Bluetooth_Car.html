                        Bluetooth has always been something I wanted to expereiment with and this car was my chance. I wanted to step away from arduino and try something new. 
                        This decisission lead me to the Raspberry PI market and I really enjoyed the switch. Having a full operating system on such a small device yet still having the 
                        easy acces to the GPIO opened up a whole bunch of possibilities. In this project I mainly focuse on using Bluetooth low enery with a couple GPIO's to handle the controls 
                        of the car. I used a stepper motor to drive the steering mechanism that I designed. This allow for much smoother steering and better control of the vehicle.

                        The project as always proved to be more challenging then I expected. Just designing the car and printing everything took 10+ hours. After that I began messing around with the bluetooth
                        which I was very comfortable with byte manipulation in C and C++ but it took me a second to understand how to do this in python. I also had the fun challenge of mixing an operating 
                        system with a bare metal system. I was pretty happy with the end product but learned why remote controlled cars use radio frequency and not bluetooth as the car ran out of range at about 
                        30 feet.
