                        This class was very cool and extremely challenging. As you can see from the list of concepts covered, we tackled a lot in one semester.
                        It was my first experience with ROS, though I was already comfortable with Docker and Linux. Everything we worked on was written
                        in Python. We were only allowed to use a camera as our sensor, which meant a lot of image processingâ€”hence the use of the Jetson Nano.
                        <br><br>
                        While the robot might look a bit "drunk" in the video, it was actually a huge success. It turned out to be one of the best driving cars in the class, 
                        which gave me newfound respect for everyone working on self-driving technology. Having a LIDAR or another sensor for additional redundancy would have
                        been helpful, but the project still worked out well in the end. Learning about image processing was fascinating, and it's far more complex than many people realize.
                        <br><br>
                        At the end of the day, the computer only sees a bunch of 1s and 0s, so getting it to recognize objects that we can easily see is no small feat. 
                        Overall, I really enjoyed this project and found it very satisfying to just turn the robot on and watch it navigate around the city. This was the 
                        first time this class was taught at BYU, so much of the learning was self-directed. The "passing on the left" functionality was our freestyle project at 
                        the end of the semester.
