                        This was another very enjoyable school project. As mentioned earlier, it was a full-stack project that included designing in 
                        SystemVerilog, developing a character driver, creating a software driver interface, and finally implementing a large C++ project 
                        to run the Space Invaders game. While I didn't build the entire hardware design shown in the image, I worked with the basic block
                        design provided to the class and edited the IPs needed for the project.
                        <br><br>
                        I learned a lot from this project, including how to interface with hardware through registers, the importance of timing, and most importantly, 
                        how to bridge the software world with the hardware world using Linux drivers. This has always intrigued me, and what better way to learn than 
                        by building a fun Space Invaders game?!
                        <br><br>
                        I didn't manage to record the final version of this project as I started this website after the project was submitted. The video here demonstrates 
                        the basic functionality of the game. However, I also added audio to the system and incorporated a driver to adjust the game's clock speed through sysfs,
                        rather than using a device file as done with the main character driver.
