                        This was yet another very fun school project. As mentioned above this was a full stack project including a little design in system verilog, character driver
                        development, software driver interface and finally a large c++ project to run the actual space invaders game. I did not build the entire Hardware design as shown 
                        in the image rather the basic block design was provided to the class and went in and edited the IP's needed for the project. I learned a lot in this project from 
                        how to interface with hardware through registers, importance of timing and most importantly how to link the software world to the hardware world with linux drivers. This 
                        has always beeen something thats intrigued me and what better way to learn then building a fun Space invaders game. 
                        <br><br>
                        I failed to get a final recording of this project as I didn't think to make this website until after the project was submitted. In this video you can see the basic functionality
                        of the game. However, I did add audio to the system and incorporated a driver to adjust the clock speed of the game through sysfs rather than using a device file as was done 
                        with the main character driver for the game.
