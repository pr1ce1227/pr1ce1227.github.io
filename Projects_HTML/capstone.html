                        For our Capstone project, we were tasked with developing a system to measure corn stalk stiffness to aid in agricultural research and storm protection. 
                        Our final product is shown above. In the picture, you can see two 
                        metal bars (whiskers) positioned in front of and behind the sensor. These whiskers are attached to two encoders that, along with some algorithms, 
                        determine the robot's current direction. More specifically, they provide the angle at which the robot is heading relative to the corn row.
                        <br><br>
                        The main sensor in the middle is connected to a Wheatstone bridge capable of measuring very subtle forces applied along the shaft, with one sensor for the x-axis and another
                        for the y-axis. By combining the forces in these directions and the robot's angle to the corn stalk row, we can calculate the force the corn stalk exerts against 
                        our sensor. While the process is a bit more complicated, this gives a general idea. For more detailed information, please refer to the PDF below.
                        <br><br>
                        My team consisted of three mechanical engineers, two electrical engineers, and one computer engineer (myself). My role was to handle all graphics and data 
                        processing onboard. We didn't process all the data live as the Raspberry Pi wasn't powerful enough for that task. Instead, I needed to read the sensors
                        and store the data in a format that could be offloaded later.
                        <br><br>
                        I had never used Kivy for graphics before, but I had some pre-built code from the project sponsor. Ultimately, I got it working, and I learned
                        why I am not a front-end engineer. Despite the challenges, I enjoyed working with my teammates, who were all motivated and skilled in their respective areas. 
                        This project, though not the most glamorous, opened my eyes to the experience of working on a long-term (one year) project with multiple engineering fields. 
                        Our goal was to create a functional product that researchers could use in the field, and we managed to achieve this by the end of the year.
                        <br><br>
                        Our sponsor was pleased with the result and impressed with our innovative ideas. In the video, you can see the sensor mounted on a FARM-ng robot, 
                        which we used for testing purposes. Although this robot was not part of the project, the sensor could theoretically be mounted on other peice farm equipment, such as a sprayer,
                        to collect data during normal operations.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this project was more challenging than we originally thought, but we succeeded in creating a working sensor with custom machined parts, two custom PCBs, 
                        and a functional user interface.
