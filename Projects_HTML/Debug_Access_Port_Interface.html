                        This was a very challenging low level software project that used the firmware of the JCM (JTAG interface). This project was tuff as most things were either not 
                        documented well or were so heavily documented it was impossible to find anything. It was also challenging as once the signal left the jcm over the JTAG cable it 
                        was very hard to see what was going on in the early stages. That being said I did eventually get this to work and it has proven to be very useful. Essentially what this 
                        does is it gives us very low level acces to the board at run time including acces to the coresight registers and global address space. With this access I can querry processor
                        registers and runtime to check things like the PC to see if they have been pushed off track. I can also set up "virtual" UARTs to each of the processors and pull of logs at runtime
                        during a test. Not to mention with acces to the global address space and the NOC I virtually have acces to every peice of the board.  
                        <br><br>
                        I learned a lot while working on this project, including that sometimes its faster to go a little slower. Working with the bits and various controllers (TAP and DAP) was tidious and 
                        required exact precision. I also learned a little more about building custom libraries in C++ and was able to abstract all the heavy lifting from the user. It's as simple as writing
                        a json file with the registers you want to read or write at run time and with a click of a button you have access to nearly the entire board. My work with this new feature has mainly
                        been involved with the Xilin Versal ACAP chip.
