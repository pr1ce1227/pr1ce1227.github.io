                        This is definitely my favorite project to date. I've always been fascinated by computer architecture, and building a processor from 
                        the ground up and running a game on it that I developed was incredibly exciting! In the class, we learned about computer architecture
                        and applied that knowledge to build a 32-bit RISC-V processor. The design included constructing data memory and program memory in BRAM,
                        as well as developing a full pipeline with fetch, decode, branch, ALU, memory, and store units. We also covered advanced topics such 
                        as ECC protection, virtual memory, paging, advanced pipelining, parallelism/multi-core, and modern design concepts. While some of 
                        these topics were too complex to be implemented in a single semester project, they provided a solid foundation in computer architecture.

                        In the video, you can see the Air-Hockey game I created. In the game, the left player is a human competing against an AI on the right side. You can adjust 
                        the difficulty using switches, as demonstrated in the video, with the difficulty increasing after each point. While the processor design was guided by the 
                        class structure, the choice of game was entirely up to us. I opted for a challenging project where everything had to be written in assembly and executed 
                        on the processor I built. Despite the challenges, it was a lot of fun, and I was thrilled with the outcome. I ended up winning first place for the best 
                        game and a $200 cash prize!
