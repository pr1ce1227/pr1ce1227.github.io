                        For our Capstone project we were asked to develop a way to measure corn stalk stiffness to help in agricultural research and storm protection. We developed
                        the final product shown above. This is one of the projects that I wish I would have taken more pictures. However in the picture you can see the 2 metal bars 
                        (whiskers) in front of and behind the sensor. These wisker are atatched to 2 encoders that with a couple of algorithms give the direction that the robot is currently 
                        facing. More specifically at what angle is it headed in relation to the corn row. We then have the main sensor in the middle which is hooked up to wheetstone bridge capable 
                        of measuring very suddle forces applied along the shaft. There is one in the x axis and one in the y axis. By taking the combined force in these direction and the angle 
                        that the robot is to the corn stalk row we are able to solve for how much force the corn stalk is able to push back agains our sensor. It's a little more complicated then 
                        that but it give you the general idea. For a more detail report look into the pdf below.

                        My team was made up of 3 mechanical, 2 electrical and 1 computer engineer, myself. My task was to handle all the graphics and data processing on board. We didn't process all the 
                        datat live as the PI wasn't strong enough for such a task. I simply need to read the sensors and store it in a format that could be offloaded later. I had never used kivy graphics 
                        before and after using it am sure there is a better solution. However the sponsor of the project had some pre-built code that we needed to encorporated into the project. Long 
                        story short I eventually got it working and learned why I am not a front-end engineer. That being said I really enjoyed working with my teamates, everyone was motivated and skilled
                        in their own areas. Although this wasn't the most glamorous project it really helped open my eyes as what its like to work on a long term project (1 year) with multiple 
                        engineering fields. Our goal was to have a working product that we would be able to hand off to researchers to use in the field. We were barely able to accomplish this task by the end 
                        of the year. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our sponsor was pleased with the result and impressed with our new ideas. In the video you can see we have it mounted to a FARM-ng robot. This is not a part of the project we just
                        needed a robot that we could test the sensor on. In theory it could easily be mounted to another peice of farm equipment that is already passing through the field like a sprayer and collect 
                        data during normal operations. Overall it was much harder than it sound but we were able to create the working sensor with custom machined parts, 2 custom PCB's and a working user interface.
