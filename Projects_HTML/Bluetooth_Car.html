                        Bluetooth has always been something I wanted to experiment with, and this car was my chance. I wanted to step away from Arduino and try something
                        new. This decision led me to the Raspberry Pi market, and I really enjoyed the switch. Having a full operating system on such a small device
                        while still having easy access to the GPIO opened up a whole bunch of possibilities.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        In this project, I mainly focused on using Bluetooth Low Energy with a couple of GPIOs to handle the car's controls. I used a stepper motor to drive the steering 
                        mechanism that I designed, allowing for much smoother steering and better control of the vehicle.
                        <br><br>
                        The project, as always, proved to be more challenging than I expected. Just designing the car and printing everything took over 10 hours. After that, I began 
                        messing around with the Bluetooth. While I was comfortable with byte manipulation in C and C++, it took me a moment to understand how to do this in Python. I also had the fun challenge of mixing an operating system with a bare-metal system.
                        I was pretty happy with the end product but learned why remote-controlled cars use radio frequency and not Bluetooth, as the car ran out of range at about 30 feet.
