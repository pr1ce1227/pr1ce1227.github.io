                        The JCM has been an ongoing project at BYU and was the first project I conducted research on. I am still using this board today for my
                        research on AI engines. This project was particularly enjoyable as it gave me my first experience in building a full-stack system. 
                        I began by working with the custom JTAG IP built by BYU students. There was a known bug when transferring data LSB first, which I 
                        addressed by working with testbenches to find and fix the bug. I then implemented the new IP into the system project, incorporating 
                        it into the block design.
                        <br><br>
                        Next, I worked with the Linux character drivers we built to interface with this IP. This involved learning about the kernel, system calls, and how these calls 
                        could be manipulated to read and write the registers on our JTAG IP, which would control the device. I also learned about DMA (Direct Memory Access) and how 
                        it can be used to free up the processor to perform other tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        We continue to use this board to configure other boards, including the Xilinx Versal ACAP. It is also used for logging and debugging, as seen in my
                        ARM DAP project. I am constantly updating the software used with this board to support new boards and functionalities. Through this project,
                        I have learned much about CMake, cross-compiling, GitHub, and managing large-scale projects. This board has proven to be invaluable, and I am
                        glad to have been one of the students to work on it.
