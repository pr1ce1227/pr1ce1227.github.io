                        The JCM has been an on-going project at BYU and happens to be the first project I did research on. I am still using this board today with my research
                        on AI engines. This was a fun project and gave me my first glimpse at building a full stack system. I began my working by working with the custom JTAG IP 
                        built by BYU students. There was a known bug when transfering data LSB first. I worked with testbenches to get to find and fix this bug then implemented the new 
                        IP in the system project incorporating the IP in the block design. 
                        <br><br>
                        I then began working with the linux character drivers we built to interface with this IP. I learned all bout the kernal, system calls and how these call could 
                        be manipulated to read and write the register on our JTAG IP which would in turn control the device. I also learned about DMA's and how they can be used to free up 
                        your processor to perform other tasks. 
                        <br><br>
                        We still use this board to configure other boards that we are working with including the Xilinx Versal ACAP. We also use it for logging and debugging as you will see in 
                        my ARM DAP project. I am constantly updating the software that is used with this board to support new boards and new functionality. It has been on this project that I learned
                        much about cmake, cross compiling, github and how to manage a large scale project. This board has proven to be invaluable and I'm glad to have been one of the students to 
                        have worked on it.
